# On Windows:

Using Chocolatey, install python2, wixtoolset, cmake, and git

Manually install Qt SDK by downloading from Qt's website.
- when picking components to install, choose default mingw option, not msvc stuff.  You can deselect everything else.  I did version 5.8.

Install the latest Visual Studio Community (I used 2017)

Install [Bonjour SDK for Windows](https://developer.apple.com/download/more/?q=Bonjour%20SDK%20for%20Windows).  You'll need to login with an Apple ID to download it, which is annoying.

Add cmake and qt to path.

```powershell
$Env:Path += ';C:\Program Files\Cmake\bin'
# Assuming Qt was installed to the default location:
$env:path += ';C:\Qt\5.8\mingw53_32\bin'
$env:path += ';C:\Qt\Tools\mingw530_32\bin'
```

Make does not like spaces in filenames.  Bonjour installs into C:\Program Files\... by default.  To fix this:

```powershell
# In cmd.exe (I don't know how to make symlinks in powershell)
mklink /D C:\bonjour-sdk "C:\Program Files\Bonjour SDK"
# back in powershell...
$env:BONJOUR_SDK_HOME = 'C:\bonjour-sdk'
```

Run the build:

```powershell
.\hm.cmd conf -g7
# TODO in src/gui/Makefile.Release, wrap all "$(BONJOUR_SDK_HOME)/" lines in double quotes because BONJOUR_SDK_HOME has a space in it.
.\hm.cmd build
.\hm.cmd package win
```

Packaging on Windows was broken on my machine. (something to do with WiX?)  This script should do the job well enough as a replacement:

```powershell
mkdir package
cp bin/Release/* ./package
@(
    'libgcc_s_dw2-1.dll',
    'libstdc++-6.dll',
    'libwinpthread-1.dll',
    'Qt5Core.dll',
    'Qt5Gui.dll',
    'Qt5Network.dll',
    'Qt5Widgets.dll'
) | % {
    cp ('C:\Qt\5.8\mingw53_32\bin\' + $_) ('./package/' + $_)
}
```
...then zip up the ./package directory.
